## General info
The purpose of this project is to understand the concept of html and css from the ground up. This project gave me a better understanding of the complexities of building a webpage given that there was no starter code and only a mockup to go by. The main challenges I encountered while building the page was media queries and flexbox. Definitely buffed out some of the kinks in both of those through this project.
